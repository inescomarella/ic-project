```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This work is useful to model occupancy considering the detection per site.

## Motivation

This project is part of my Scientific Initiation project, entitled "Habitat selection and competitive relationships among carnivores in a fragmented landscape". The work was funded by FAPES/Vale 2015.

## Including Code

You can include R code in the document as follows:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
