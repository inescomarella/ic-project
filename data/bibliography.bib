Data show that canine tooth length is greater among small domestic dogs when compared to small wild dogs, and large wild dogs when compared among large domestic dogs. Tooth strength is also greater among small domestic dogs and large wild dogs. The greater tooth strength of the small domestic dogs may be attributed to the idea that small domestic dogs are closer in ancestry to the grey wolf (Canis lupus) than are small wild canids. Skull foreshortening and tooth strength appear to be correlated in the canidae. {\textcopyright} 1992, Gustav Fischer Verlag Jena GmbH. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Anthropoid primates are well known for their highly sexually dimorphic canine teeth, with males possessing canines that are up to 400{\%} taller than those of females. Primate canine dimorphism has been extensively documented, with a consensus that large male primate canines serve as weapons for intrasexual competition, and some evidence that large female canines in some species may likewise function as weapons. However, apart from speculation that very tall male canines may be relatively weak and that seed predators have strong canines, the functional significance of primate canine shape has not been explored. Because carnivore canine shape and size are associated with killing style, this group provides a useful comparative baseline for primates. We evaluate primate maxillary canine tooth size, shape and relative bending strength against body size, skull size, and behavioral and demographic measures of male competition and sexual selection, and compare them to those of carnivores. We demonstrate that, relative to skull length and body mass, primate male canines are on average as large as or larger than those of similar sized carnivores. The range of primate female canine sizes embraces that of carnivores. Male and female primate canines are generally as strong as or stronger than those of carnivores. Although we find that seed-eating primates have relatively strong canines, we find no clear relationship between male primate canine strength and demographic or behavioral estimates of male competition or sexual selection, in spite of a strong relationship between these measures and canine crown height. This suggests either that most primate canines are selected to be very strong regardless of variation in behavior, or that primate canine shape is inherently strong enough to accommodate changes in crown height without compromising canine function. {\textcopyright} 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

@article{Gittleman1997,
abstract = {Sexual dimorphism in craniodental features is investigated in a sample of 45 carnivore species in relation to allometry, phylogeny, and behavioural ecology. Dimorphism is more pronounced in both upper and lower canine size and strength than in carnassial size, skull dimensions and biomechanical features, but all dimorphism indices covary. As with most morphological characters, differences in canine sexual dimorphism are significantly related to phylogeny, estimated from either taxonomic rankings or a limited matrix of molecular distances; in particular, mustelids, felids and procyonids are more dimorphic than other carnivore families. Thus, because of problems related to species dependence in comparative data, remaining analyses are based on phylogenetically transformed values using a spatial autoregressive method. In contrast to other mammals, sexual dimorphism in carnivore canines is not correlated with differences in body weight, skull length or basicranial axis length. Nor is it correlated with categorical variables of activity pattern, habitat, or diet. In our carnivore sample, canine dimorphism is related only to breeding system: uni-male, group-living (harem) species have significantly greater canine dimorphism than multi male, multi-female groups and monogamous pair-bonding species. By contrast, dimorphism in carnassial size is related to dietary differences, specifically greater dimorphism in meat eating species, and not breeding patterns. Dimorphism in estimates of jaw muscle size suggest functional demands from both diet and breeding type. It is concluded that, befitting patterns of heterodont dentition, sexual selection influences variation in canine dimorphism while feeding ecology is related to carnassial dimorphism.},

abstract = {The strength of canine teeth in several carnivores is found through direct fracture experiments. The average forces required to break the canines of adult animals are coyote 1170 N, red fox 533 N, bobcat 737 N and raccoon 512 N. Stresses created in teeth at the breaking load are predicted by finite-element analysis and beam theory. The ultimate tensile stress sustainable in these teeth is 338 MPa in adult animals. The large pulp cavity in the canines of young animals significantly weakens the bases of their teeth (by about 25{\%}), but as the animal ages the pulp cavity decreases and has little effect on overall tooth strength. The tooth material of young of the year is significantly weaker than that from older animals (by about 35{\%}). With the experimentally derived ultimate tensile stress, finite-element analysis can estimate the breaking load of canines for several carnivores. A significant allometric relationship exists between log of body weight and log of strength of tooth (slope=0.81). {\textcopyright} 2007 The Zoological Society of London.},

abstract = {Skull variables were analysed for allometry patterns in 56 species of extant carnivores. As previously reported, many skull variables scale near isometrically with either skull length or lower jaw length. The maximal gape angle scales insignificantly (P {\textless} 0.05) with skull size, but the clearance between the canines shows a significant relationship with skull size and scales near isometrically. Maximal bite forces were estimated from geometrical cross-sectional areas of dried skulls, and the bending strength of the canines was computed by modelling the canines as a cantilevered beam of solid, homogeneous material with an elliptical cross section. Previous hypotheses of large taxon differences in canine bending strengths, so that felids have stronger canines than canids, are corroborated when actual bite forces at the upper canine are ignored. Incorporation of bite force values, however, nullifies the differences in canine bending strength among felids and canids, and ursids seem to have stronger canines than felids. This is probably because of the significantly longer canines of felids compared to canids and ursids, and the generally high bite forces of felids. {\textcopyright} 2005 The Zoological Society of London.},

@article{Macdonald1996,
abstract = {1) Crab-eating zorros, Cerdocyon thous, in Amazonian Brazil weighed 5.2 kg (S.D. 0.6, n= 19), exhibited no sexual dimorphism, lived in social units of 2-5 adults of {\textgreater} 1 year old, and occupied territories (restricted polygons) of 532 ha (range 48-1042 ha, n= 21). 2) The zorros were omnivorous, fruit being the most frequent food (occurring in 57{\%} of 72 faeces in the dry season) comprising 26.4{\%} by volume of undigested faecal remains. Insects were frequently eaten (86{\%}), and vertebrates rarely (15.2{\%}). 3) Zorros were territorial. The ranges of neighbours overlapped minimally and were very stable in configuration, both from month to month and between dry and wet seasons. Members of each social unit shared on average 88.3{\%} of 200 × 200m grid cells within their territory. Members of male-female breeding pairs were within 100 m of each other for 63{\%} of the activity period, their proximity being greatest during the mating season (July-August). Parents travelled in close company with their adult-sized offspring, and stayed within 100 m for up to 93.3{\%} of the activity period. 4) Territories differed in habitat composition. Overall, zorros spent most time in wooded savanna (33.9{\%}) and scrub (30.5{\%}). They did not utilize habitats in direct proportion to their availability, using some more (e.g. scrub) and some less (e.g. open savanna) than expected. Habitat preferences differed between wet and dry seasons, with elevated habitats being favoured during the wet season. 5) Individuals differed in their habitat utilization, and parents had different habitat usage to their yearling offspring; this difference was exaggerated in the dry season when the yearlings used lowlying habitats apparently disfavoured by the parents. Differences in habitat utilization between group members were least in the wet season, when widespread flooding forced the shared use of higher ground. 6) Each of two social units larger than two individuals comprised a pair and their three adult-sized offspring (totalling five males and one female). In three cases, a yearling daughter was present in the breeding season, but none of these bred. Non-breeding offspring were seen frequently in the whelping area and in close company with the breeding pair's cubs. This is the first proof of group-living in South American zorros. 7) Five dispersal events were monitored, and revealed a 'good neighbour'strategy in which newly formed pairs set up their territories adjoining their natal territories. In each case individuals returned intermittently to their original territory where they were in close and amicable company with their parents. One male, having dispersed, returned home frequently without his mate to tend the next generation of his parents'cubs. Of four dispersing males, two subsequently returned to their natal group following the deaths of their mates at least 3-13 months after their initial dispersal, in one case after breeding elsewhere. 1996 The Zoological Society of London.},

Data reported here include weight, shoulder height, head and body, tail, hind foot, head, and ear lengths, and some additional measurements for particular species.

abstract = {The occurrence of anomalous coloration (albinism, leucism and melanism) in mammals is a rare phenomenon in nature, but this phenomenon has been reported for several species of mammals. In this study, we report on the occurrence of leucism in Eira barbara by examining three road-killed individuals and two sightings of live animals in Reserva Particular do Patrim{\^{o}}nio Natural Santu{\'{a}}rio do Cara{\c{c}}a, southeastern Brazil. In addition, we examined tayra specimens housed in mammal collections from Brazil and USA. The animals found dead and those sighted had a whitish yellow fur on the body and head, resulting in lighter coloration than the coloring pattern commonly observed in tayras. Despite these lighter color pattern, the specimens showed parts of soft tissue, such as iris and the skin, with pigmentation very similar to that present in individuals with the typical color pattern. This set of factors indicates the specimens recorded were in fact leucistic and not albino. Among the specimens examined in the scientific collections, we found nine individuals from different localities that presented the whitish yellow color pattern. Some studies attribute the higher frequency of cases of leucism due to small populations and / or with some mechanism of reproductive isolation. Thus, analysis of the genetic variability of populations containing individuals with such characteristics should be considered. On the other hand, the occurrence of polymorphic color phenotype in tayras indicates that hypotheses related to the fixation of recessive characteristics, or on possible environmental adaptive advantages of these phenotypes can be tested.},

Probably more than 20 other species, either new to science or new to Bolivia, remain to be discovered. In addition to these species names, some 44 additional subspecies names are used. Most of the subspecies names reflect taxonomic history more than detailed knowledge of geographic variation. In this report, the taxonomic status of each taxon within Bolivia is noted. Scientific names that have been used for Bolivian specimens are given for each species and subspecies, and all known publications that have specifically referred to Bolivian specimens are cited, along with a few other works selected for special reasons. Specimens are listed, and localities are mapped, including the prediction of the probable distribution of each species within Bolivia. Illustrated keys are based primarily on external, cranial, and dental characters and include 10 domestic and introduced species in addition to native species. The number of species present in most local areas ranges from about 50 to 180. Analysis indicates four major faunal areas: lowland tropics, lowland temperature zone (including the chacoan area), forested yungas, and highlands (altiplano). The highland and lowland faunas are almost mutually exclusive; the break between temperate and tropical is indistinct. Source: BIOSIS},
